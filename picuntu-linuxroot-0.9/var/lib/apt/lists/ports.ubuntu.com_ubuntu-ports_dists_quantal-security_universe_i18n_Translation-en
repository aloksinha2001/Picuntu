Description-en: multiuser MPM for Apache 2.2
 The ITK Multi-Processing Module (MPM) works in about the same way as the

 you to constrain each individual vhost to a particular system user. This
 allows you to run several different web sites on a single server without
 worrying that they will be able to read each others' files. This is a
 third-party MPM that is not included in the normal Apache httpd.

 Please note that this MPM is somewhat less tested than the MPMs that come with
 Apache itself.
